- Created for an executive level of detail with quick KPI cards at the top
- Working down we have a revenue trend over time as well as a category bar chart
- We used a matrix to outline a quick show of top products with some rule visuals
- At the bottom we used some basic metrics to outline if goals are being hit and some more quick KPI's

Our Goal here is for a high level stakeholder to come in and be able to quick understand whats going on from a high level. We're able to outline major KPI's and filter quickly to find insight that we may need.

## <h1 align="center" id="customer-detail">Customer Detail</h1>
![customer detail](https://github.com/nmowens95/Adventure-Works/assets/126295718/6ec9dac3-41db-4c0d-9f44-62c36ebbfdf6)

## <h1 align="center">What I Learned</h1>
- It's key to understand which stakeholder at what level will need to understand a specific level of granularity
- I got to work with a lot of different DAX expressions to create time series analysis, profit adjustment and much more
- Got practice with data modeling, using power query and designing a basic mobile view

## <h1 align="center">Personal Insight</h1>
- The United States is the largest contributor to orders, next is Australia. There should be a greater empasis on marketing in these regions in order to push further sales.
- Over time as the return rate has increased, though this seems alarming, it is steady in percentage along with total increase of orders. Thus it isn't something to be overly worried about.
